# Sense

### Where did sense spawn from?

-> Be Lou <br>
-> Want to send messages in my Slack channel through my Slack bot about my spending <br>
-> Bank doesn't have an API <br>
-> WHAT SHOULD I DO??

So that's where Sense came in but it was a little different because I never actually used it as intended lol.

### "You've yapped alot Lou, what is Sense?"

Sense is a YNAB replica (a budgetting app I loved using but I'm not dropping ~$49.99 a month man) that hopes to solve issues YNAB is having:

1. Being paid and EXPENSIVE
2. A somewhat complex UI

#### Sense lets you do a lot:

- You can have multiple spending accounts
  ![]()
- Set spending goals!
  ![]()
- Use categories to split your spending
  ![]()
- Track how much you spend and get weekly statistics about your spending.

This was originally made for Neighborhood but I moved it over to Shipwrecked :) This was my first mobile app and I got lots of help from expo docs, Cursor and guesswork!

### Wanna replicate this locally?

1. Clone this repo
2. For the frontend: <br>
   run `cd frontend`<br>
   run `npm install`<br>
   run `npx expo start`
   <br>
3. For the backend: <br>
   run `cd server`<br>
   run `npm install`<br>
   run `node server.js`
